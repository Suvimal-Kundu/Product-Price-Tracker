# INTRODUCTION

We are going to build out a project using python here. You can also consider this as good beginner project as it also includes scrapping.
We will be using python to make requests and do webscraping on amazon.com.

We will use BeautifulSoup and Requests.

bs4: This is a dummy package managed by the developer of Beautiful Soup to prevent name squatting. The official name of PyPIâ€™s Beautiful Soup Python package is beautifulsoup4. This package ensures that if you type pip install bs4 by mistake you will end up with Beautiful Soup.

requests: Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. Requests is a simple, yet elegant HTTP library.
